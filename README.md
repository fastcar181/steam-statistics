# Steam Statistics

This is a simple program that uses Steam's public API to display data and statistics for users depending on their Steam ID.

**NOTE:** This program is currently in its simplest form, but I will be updating it as I continue to develop an understanding of APIs.

## Requirements
You will need a **Steam API key** and the **Steam ID** of the profiles you wish to view. To register for a Steam API key, visit the [Steam site](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) for more info!

## Installation
Make sure to do `pip install requests` to import the requests module!

## Usage
In your Windows terminal, move to the directory with the application and then type `python main.py` to run it!
